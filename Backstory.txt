DOG TOOTH

Dog tooth is made to be a part of an anthology set in the future where supernatural things don't seem as un-normal and is more of a daily thing and people are ok with that. 
A worker Named Cyd is tasked with going to space in an office base of scientists that work in the supernatural section of the organization, that means Alchemy and summoning ghosts type research. 
The problem is the office has been abandoned for years no one knows where the workers have gone…SUPPOSABLY. 
The base is left in like this really bad, GOD AWFUL condition. 
The only Info you have is a document detailing the daily research checkpoints, but the document is HEAVILY edited and leaves out the really good, juicy important parts. 
The document talks about how the head scientist Gavin Piper had an alchemic prophecy about being able to bring back the dead with some sort of formula. 
Gavin is given a budget to run experiments and pay for materials. He became OBSESSED with the premonition and has endless tests in order to fulfill it. 
Most of the test subjects are house pets because they are the easiest to get a hold of when they are “abandoned” by owners. 
One experiment proves very promising after hundreds have failed, he's running to his wits end because Rise is about to cut funding to the whole project and mostly fire him. 
Gavin was able to regenerate some injuries that have been caused in a controlled manner. As it is with anything that seems too good, the test subject starts to change. 
Logs kept track of the unnatural behavior of the test subject as it deteriorates to something worse and. It turns out to be too much for the supernatural research group to handle...RIP. 
It's your job to save the day MAYBE. Also There may or may not be a rabid possessed dog out to get you when you reach the basement floor of the space office. 
But I'm not gonna tell you because I don't  wanna spoil the game.
